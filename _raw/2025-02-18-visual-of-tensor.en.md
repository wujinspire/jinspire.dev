# The capital of France is ___

When a large model generates a new word, how do the matrices inside the model change?

# Matrix Multiplication

Let's visualize matrix multiplication first. Note how the dimensions of the two matrices are matched, we will use this pattern in below visualizations.

![mat_mul]({{ '/assets/images/posts/mat_mul.png' | relative_url }})

Blue: Data (Tensor)

Grey: Model Weights

# Embedding

![embedding_layer]({{ '/assets/images/posts/embedding_layer.png' | relative_url }})

Start with the embedding layer. Assume one word equals one token.

Input sentence: The capital of France is ___

-> ['The', 'capital', 'of', 'France', 'is']

-> [464, 3361, 295, 2238, 318], which are their Token IDs

This forms a [1, 5] vector.

The data now enters an embedding table of size [50,000, 768] to look up:
- The     = [0.316, 0.524, 0.063, …]
- capital = [0.123, 0.234, 0.345, …]
- of      = [0.432, 0.543, 0.654, …]
- France  = [0.543, 0.654, 0.765, …]
- is      = [0.654, 0.765, 0.876, …]

-> Thus, we obtain a [5, 768] matrix!

We pad (appending 0s) it to length 1024, which now becomes [1024, 768].

# Transformer Block

![transformer_block]({{ '/assets/images/posts/transformer_block.png' | relative_url }})

Three key matrices: Q, K, V. Each is [768, 64] * 12.

For one head, [1024, 768] * [768, 64] = [1024, 64]

Q 12 heads = [1024, 64] + [1024, 64] + ... + [1024, 64]

= [1024, 64] * 12 = [1024, 768]

K and V are the same.

K^T = [768, 1024]

QK^T = [1024, 1024]

Softmax(QK^T/√d) = [1024, 1024]

Attn = Softmax(QK^T/√d) * V = [1024, 768]

MLP has two layers: one expands 4x using [768 × 3072] and one contracts using [3072 × 768]

Change: [1024, 768] -> [1024, 3072] -> [1024, 768]

# The Whole Process

![transformer_tensors]({{ '/assets/images/posts/transformer_tensors.png' | relative_url }})

Extract the last row: [768]

Then, use the original embedding table [50,000, 768] to map back to a Token ID, retrieving the final word: Paris

# Parameters of Models

All the transformer models have a similar structure, just different numbers of layers(12), d_model(768), d_head(64), etc. The appendix shows the number of parameters for the famous models.

Latest research aims to reduce the total number of parameters using different attention mechanisms (e.g., MLA, NSA), which is not the focus of this article.

Thank you for reading! 🎉 🥰 🫡
